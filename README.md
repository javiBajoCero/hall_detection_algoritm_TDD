# hall_detection_algoritm_TDD
This repository contains all code and automated tests for my Master's thesis.
I was tasked to develop an easy algorythm , i could probably had finished it in a weekend.    
But i decided instead for this to be the perfect oportunity to overengineer the process, and to try to apply what i believe to be Test driven development for the first time.    
That means , first we develop all the tests (Hardware also)  --> then we develop the actuall target algorythm.
