# hall_detection_algoritm_TDD
This repository contains all code and automated tests for my Master's thesis.
I was tasked to develop an easy algorythm , i could probably had finished it in a weekend.    
But i decided instead for this to be the perfect oportunity to overengineer the process, and to try to apply what i believe to be Test driven development for the first time.    

That means , first we develop at the same time the tests (Hardware also)  + the actuall target algorythm.    
All tests are automated and stacked on top of older tests.
All tests need to pass every time there is a new change or a new test is added.

- Gene Schroeder's embedded CI/CD course (he uses jenkins and im using github actions, still very educative) https://github.com/g-schro/ci-cd-class-1
