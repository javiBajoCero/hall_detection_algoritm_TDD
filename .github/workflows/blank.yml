# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: self-hosted

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # just a fun text and the date
      - name: update .txt
        run: |
          cd tester_code_and_testing_results
          echo Last run was on \n $(date) >runner_logs.txt
          ls
      # build the tester code project, makefile //makefile previously installed "sudo apt install make" (it comes with raspbian already i think)
      - name: run makefile on tester code
        run: |
          cd tester_code_and_testing_results/hall_error_emulator_nucleo-G431RB
